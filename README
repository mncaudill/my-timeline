myTimeline will be a way to view events of your life, both spatially and temporally. 

With more services attaching geodata to events (e.g., Twitter messages, Flickr photos), I thought it'd be interesting to see all these events on with a time control to see what happened and where.

Currently, all this project does is fetch Flickr photos and Twitter messages and store them and display them on the map. The plan is to eventually add a time control to only show pieces of this data at a time. 

The code is prototype quality right now as I'm just winging it.
